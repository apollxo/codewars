## Codewars Practices
Some best practices for practice questions on [codewars](http://www.codewars.com/) and try to update it constantly from 2022

**Notes:** The best practices for every question I have passed all tests on codewars were sorted via votes count descending at the time I resolved it, so you maybe see different results now for the same question on codewars.
