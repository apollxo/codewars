## Codewars Practices
Some best practices for practice questions on [codewars](http://www.codewars.com/) and try to update it weekly from Jul 16, 2018.

**Notes:** The best practices for every question I have passed all tests on codewars were sorted via votes count descending at the time I resolved it, so you maybe see different results now for the same question on codewars.

Here is my codewars homepage: https://www.codewars.com/users/apollo18
